  "document_summary": "Poor Charlie's Almanack compiles Charles T. Munger's wisdom on investing, decision-making, and life, presenting his multidisciplinary approach to worldly wisdom. Munger advocates building a latticework of mental models from diverse academic disciplines\u2014particularly psychology, mathematics, physics, and economics\u2014to achieve superior judgment. His investment philosophy emphasizes patience, discipline, and concentration: waiting for obvious opportunities ('one-foot fences'), making large bets on exceptional businesses with pricing power and ethical management, and holding long-term with minimal turnover. Central to his approach is understanding human psychology and misjudgment tendencies, using inversion (thinking problems backward), staying within circles of competence, and recognizing that ideology, incentive-caused bias, and narrow specialization impair cognition. The book demonstrates that Berkshire Hathaway's extraordinary success came not from constant activity but from approximately ten major insights across two lifetimes, combined with extreme selectivity, intellectual humility about knowledge limits, and systematic avoidance of mistakes through checklists and multidisciplinary analysis.",

      "description": "Applying narrow disciplinary lens to all problems; relying exclusively on specialized expertise; seeing all problems through single framework (legal, financial, psychological, etc.); ignoring models from other disciplines",
      "why_wrong": "Complex reality requires multiple models from multiple disciplines; single-lens analysis misses critical factors and leads to systematic errors; unidisciplinary approach to multidisciplinary problems guarantees failure; like playing bridge by counting trumps while ignoring all else",
      "fix": "Build latticework of approximately 80-90 models from major disciplines; apply multiple frameworks simultaneously; think multidisciplinarily despite academic discouragement; recognize that truly big ideas from each discipline carry most intellectual freight"

      "name": "Ignoring Incentive-Caused Bias",
      "description": "Trusting professional advisers without recognizing their conflicts of interest; believing recommendations are objective when they align with adviser's financial interests; failing to ask 'whose bread I eat, his song I sing'",
      "why_wrong": "Subconscious bias (not conscious malfeasance) systematically distorts advice; advisers unconsciously favor solutions that benefit themselves; most investment disasters come from following conflicted advice; 'every profession is a conspiracy against the laity'",
      "fix": "Always identify adviser's incentives and discount recommendations accordingly; do your own multidisciplinary thinking rather than delegating to specialists; recognize that adviser's bias is usually subconscious, not malicious; appeal to self-interest when trying to influence behavior"

      "why_wrong": "Psychological commitment and denial prevent rational adjustment to new information; sunk cost fallacy causes doubling down on losers; consistency principle makes people defend initial choices regardless of evidence; many go broke through inability to abandon losing commitments",
      "fix": "Remain situation-dependent and opportunity-driven rather than position-loyal; practice Darwin's method of immediately noting disconfirming evidence; use checklists to overcome denial; accept that there's no way to live adequately without making mistakes\u2014learn to recognize and fix them fast"

      "why_wrong": "Complexity adds costs (often 3%+ annually) without improving returns; creates febezzlement where middlemen extract wealth; simple approaches often outperform after accounting for fees; overconfidence from excessive professionalism causes major errors; 'physics envy' drives inappropriate quantification",
      "fix": "Keep systems as simple as possible but no simpler; recognize that 80-90 fundamental models carry most freight; use indexing or concentrated positions in understood businesses; avoid structures with multiple fee layers; question whether complexity serves clients or providers"

      "fix": "Know precisely where circle of competence boundaries lie; admit 'I don't know' without shame when outside expertise; expand circle slowly through learning, but recognize it will always have limits; decline opportunities outside competence regardless of apparent attractiveness"
