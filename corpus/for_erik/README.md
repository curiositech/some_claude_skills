## "How Experts Think" (Core Theory)

The foundational NDM/expertise texts.

- **`The_Recognition_Primed_Decision_Model.pdf`** — RPD (Klein) — the central model: experts don't compare options, they recognize patterns and simulate forward

- **`Conditions_for_intuitive_expertise_A_fai.pdf`** — The famous Kahneman & Klein debate paper — when can you trust expert intuition?
- **`A_Naturalistic_Study_of_Insight.pdf`** — How insight actually works in the wild (not lab puzzles)
- **`FOCUS_A_Model_of_Sensemaking.pdf`** — How experts build coherent pictures from ambiguous data
- **`Decision_models_some_lessons_from_the_fi.pdf`** — What field studies teach us that lab studies miss
- **`The_Cambridge_Handbook_of_Expertise_and.pdf`** — The big reference volume on expertise research
- **`Investigations_of_Naturalistic_Decision.pdf`** — Investigations of NDM in practice

## How to Read This Collection

The real spine is the **Klein/NDM tradition**: RPD as the theory of expert cognition, CDM as the method for extracting it, and then the domain studies showing it in action across policing, aviation, naval ops, mediation, and intelligence work.

**Start here:**
1. `The_Recognition_Primed_Decision_Model.pdf` — the core theory
2. `Critical_decision_method_for_eliciting_k.pdf` — the core method
3. `Conditions_for_intuitive_expertise_A_fai.pdf` — the crucial boundary conditions (Kahneman & Klein)

Then branch into whichever domain interests you, or dive into the CTA methods if you want to learn how to do this kind of knowledge extraction yourself.
