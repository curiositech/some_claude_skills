(Just facts)\n_________________________________\n\nEMOTION: What did you feel? (0-100%)\n_________________________________\n\nAUTOMATIC THOUGHT: What went through your mind?\n_________________________________\n\nEVIDENCE FOR the thought:\n_________________________________\n\nEVIDENCE AGAINST the thought:\n_________________________________\n\nALTERNATIVE THOUGHT: What's a more balanced view?\n_________________________________\n\nEMOTION NOW: (0-100%)\n_________________________________\n\nEXAMPLE:\n─────────\nSituation: Sponsor didn't return my call for 2 hours\n\nEmotion: Rejected (80%), Anxious (70%)\n\nAutomatic thought: \"They don't care about me. No one does.\"\n\nEvidence FOR: They usually call back faster. I've been\ncalling a lot lately.\n\nEvidence AGAINST: They have their own life and job.\nThey've shown up for me many times before.\n2 hours isn't that long.\nThey called back eventually.\n\nAlternative thought: \"They're busy and will get back to me.\nPast behavior shows they do care.\"\n\nEmotion NOW: Rejected (30%), Anxious (20%)\n```\n\n### Cognitive Distortions Checklist\n\n```\nCOMMON THINKING TRAPS\n─────────────────────\n\n□ ALL-OR-NOTHING: \"I relapsed once, I'm a total failure\"\n  → Reality is usually shades of gray\n\n□ CATASTROPHIZING: \"If I mess up, everything will fall apart\"\n  → What's the evidence? What's most likely?\n\n□ MIND READING: \"They think I'm pathetic\"\n  → Can you actually know what they think?\n\n□ FORTUNE TELLING: \"I know I'll relapse eventually\"\n  → The future isn't written yet\n\n□ EMOTIONAL REASONING: \"I feel like a failure, so I am one\"\n  → Feelings aren't facts\n\n□ SHOULD STATEMENTS: \"I should be over this by now\"\n  → Says who? Replace with \"I'd prefer\" or \"I'm working on\"\n\n□ LABELING: \"I'm an addict, that's all I am\"\n  → You are more than any single label\n\n□ PERSONALIZATION: \"They look upset, it must be my fault\"\n  → Other people have their own stuff going on\n\n□ DISCOUNTING POSITIVES: \"That doesn't count because...\"\n  → Let good things count!\n\n□ MAGNIFICATION/MINIMIZATION: Making negatives bigger,\n  positives smaller\n  → Try to see things at actual size\n```\n\n## Urge Surfing\n\n### The Complete Script\n\n```\nURGE SURFING MEDITATION (10-15 minutes)\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFind a comfortable position. You can close your eyes\nor soften your gaze.\n\nNotice that you're having an urge or craving right now.\nThis is uncomfortable, and that's okay.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge: this urge is just a sensation.\nIt's a wave that will rise, peak, and fall.\nIt cannot hurt you. It cannot make you do anything.\n\nNow, find where you feel the urge in your body.\nIs it in your stomach? Your chest? Your throat? Your hands?\nJust notice where it lives.\n\nRate the intensity from 1 to 10. ___\n\nBreathe into that area. Don't try to push the sensation away.\nJust breathe and notice.\n\nImagine you're sitting on a beach, watching waves.\nThis urge is a wave. Watch it approach.\n\nNotice how the intensity rises...\n(pause)\nAnd rises...\n(pause)\n\nNow notice: is it still rising, or has it peaked?\nCravings typically last 15-30 minutes.\nThey always pass.\n\nKeep breathing. Keep watching.\n\nNotice the intensity now. Has it changed?\nRate it again from 1 to 10. ___\n\nYou are not your urge. You are the observer of the urge.\nThe wave is passing through you, not destroying you.\n\n(Continue breathing for 5-10 minutes)\n\nWhen you're ready, notice:\n├── You survived this urge\n├── You didn't have to act on it\n├── It rose and fell, just like waves do\n└── Each time you surf an urge, you get stronger\n\nSlowly return your attention to the room.\n```\n\n## Crisis Planning\n\n### My Personal Crisis Plan\n\n```\nMY CRISIS PLAN\n──────────────\n\nWARNING SIGNS (I notice I'm getting into trouble when):\n1. _________________________________\n2. _________________________________\n3. _________________________________\n\nTRIGGERS TO WATCH FOR:\n1. _________________________________\n2. _________________________________\n3. _________________________________\n\nCOPING STRATEGIES THAT WORK FOR ME:\n1. _________________________________\n2. _________________________________\n3. _________________________________\n\nPEOPLE I CAN CALL:\n├── Sponsor: _____________ (phone)\n├── Support person: _____________ (phone)\n├── Therapist: _____________ (phone)\n├── Treatment center: _____________ (phone)\n└── Crisis line: 988 (always available)\n\nPLACES I CAN GO THAT ARE SAFE:\n1. _________________________________\n2. _________________________________\n\nTHINGS TO AVOID WHEN IN CRISIS:\n1. _________________________________\n2. _________________________________\n3. _________________________________\n\nREASONS TO STAY SOBER (Why am I doing this?):\n1. _________________________________\n2. _________________________________\n3. _________________________________\n\nI commit to using this plan when I'm struggling.\n\nSigned: _________________ Date: _________\n```\n\n---\n\n**Remember**: These skills work better with practice. Try them when you're calm so they're available when you're in crisis. Talk to your counselor about which ones work best for you.\n"

          "content": "# Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) Deep Dive\n\n## Overview\n\nMAT combines FDA-approved medications with counseling and behavioral therapies. It's evidence-based, reduces mortality by up to 50%, and is considered the gold standard for opioid use disorder treatment.\n\n## Medications for Opioid Use Disorder\n\n### Buprenorphine (Suboxone, Subutex, Sublocade)\n\n#### How It Works\n- **Partial opioid agonist**: Activates opioid receptors partially\n- **Ceiling effect**: After a certain dose, effects plateau (overdose protection)\n- **High receptor affinity**: Blocks other opioids from binding\n\n#### Formulations\n\n| Brand | Form | Frequency | Notes |\n|-------|------|-----------|-------|\n| **Suboxone** | Sublingual film/tablet | Daily | Contains naloxone (deters injection) |\n| **Subutex** | Sublingual tablet | Daily | Buprenorphine only (pregnancy) |\n| **Sublocade** | Monthly injection | Monthly | Extended-release, steady levels |\n| **Brixadi** | Weekly/monthly injection | Weekly or monthly | Newer option |\n| **Zubsolv** | Sublingual tablet | Daily | Higher bioavailability |\n\n#### Induction Protocol\n\n```\nBUPRENORPHINE INDUCTION (Traditional)\n─────────────────────────────────────\nPREREQUISITE: Must be in withdrawal\n- COWS score ≥ 12 (moderate withdrawal)\n- Last short-acting opioid use: 12-24 hours\n- Last methadone use: 24-72 hours\n- Last fentanyl use: 72+ hours (longer half-life)\n\nDAY 1:\n├── Start with 2-4mg sublingual\n├── Wait 1-2 hours, assess response\n├── If still withdrawing: add 2-4mg\n├── Max Day 1: 8mg typically\n└── Goal: Comfort, not sedation\n\nDAY 2:\n├── Give Day 1 total dose at once\n├── May increase by 4mg if needed\n└── Target: 12-16mg total\n\nDAY 3-7:\n├── Titrate to comfort\n├── Most stable at 16-24mg\n└── Max approved dose: 24mg/day\n\nCOMMON MISTAKE:\nStarting too early → precipitated withdrawal\nWait for REAL withdrawal, not just anxiety about withdrawal\n```\n\n#### Precipitated Withdrawal Warning\n\n```\nPRECIPITATED WITHDRAWAL\n───────────────────────\nWhat happens: Buprenorphine has HIGHER affinity than full agonists.\nIt kicks fentanyl/heroin OFF receptors → sudden withdrawal.\n\nSymptoms (within 1-4 hours of first dose):\n├── Severe anxiety, agitation\n├── Vomiting, diarrhea\n├── Muscle cramps, bone pain\n├── Sweating, goosebumps\n├── Elevated heart rate\n└── Often WORSE than natural withdrawal\n\nTreatment:\n├── Supportive care (fluids, comfort meds)\n├── May need to add more buprenorphine\n├── Very rarely: full agonist (controversial)\n└── Prevention: WAIT for true withdrawal\n\nWith fentanyl (the new challenge):\n├── Fentanyl stores in fat → slow release\n├── Traditional 24-hour wait often insufficient\n├── Some providers use micro-dosing protocols\n└── Discuss with your medical team\n```\n\n#### Micro-Dosing Protocols (Bernese Method)\n\n```\nMICRO-INDUCTION (for fentanyl users)\n────────────────────────────────────\nAllows starting buprenorphine WITHOUT full withdrawal.\nPatient continues using while slowly adding buprenorphine.\n\nDay 1: 0.5mg buprenorphine\nDay 2: 1mg\nDay 3: 2mg\nDay 4: 4mg\nDay 5: 8mg\nDay 6: 12mg\nDay 7: 16mg (stop other opioid use)\n\nWHY IT WORKS:\nLow doses gradually occupy receptors without\ndisplacing all the fentanyl at once.\n\nCAUTION:\n├── Should be done under medical supervision\n├── Not appropriate for everyone\n├── Requires patient to follow complex schedule\n└── Discuss with your provider\n```\n\n### Methadone\n\n#### How It Works\n- **Full opioid agonist**: Fully activates receptors\n- **Long half-life**: 24-36 hours (once daily dosing)\n- **No ceiling effect**: CAN cause overdose if misused\n- **Heavily regulated**: Dispensed at specialized clinics\n\n#### Dosing\n\n```\nMETHADONE DOSING\n────────────────\nINDUCTION:\n├── Start: 20-30mg on Day 1\n├── Observe for 2-4 hours\n├── Max Day 1: 30-40mg usually\n└── Low and slow (peak effects at 3-4 hours)\n\nTITRATION:\n├── Increase 5-10mg every 3-5 days\n├── Wait for steady state (3-5 half-lives)\n├── Typical range: 60-120mg\n├── Some need higher (fast metabolizers)\n└── Goal: No cravings, no withdrawal, no sedation\n\nSPLIT DOSING:\nSome patients metabolize fast and need twice-daily dosing.\nSigns: withdrawal symptoms in evening, not lasting 24 hours.\n```\n\n#### Clinic Structure\n\n```\nMETHADONE CLINIC PHASES\n───────────────────────\nPhase 1 (New patient):\n├── Daily clinic visits\n├── Observed dosing\n├── Building trust and stability\n└── Duration: 90 days typically\n\nPhase 2:\n├── 2-3 take-homes per week\n├── Regular counseling\n├── Clean UDS required\n└── Duration: 6+ months\n\nPhase 3:\n├── 6 take-homes per week\n├── Monthly counseling minimum\n├── Long-term stability\n└── Years of compliance\n\nTAKE-HOME CRITERIA:\n├── Clean urine drug screens\n├── Counseling attendance\n├── No behavioral issues\n├── Time in treatment\n└── Varies by state/clinic\n```\n\n### Naltrexone (Vivitrol)\n\n#### How It Works\n- **Opioid antagonist**: BLOCKS receptors completely\n- **No agonist activity**: Cannot get high on opioids while taking\n- **Not addictive**: No withdrawal from naltrexone itself\n- **Also used for alcohol**: Reduces cravings, blocks \"high\"\n\n#### Formulations\n\n| Form | Brand | Frequency | Notes |\n|------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Monthly injection | Vivitrol | Every 28 days | 380mg IM in gluteal |\n| Daily pill | ReVia/generic | Daily | 50mg oral |\n\n#### Important Considerations\n\n```\nNALTREXONE REQUIREMENTS\n───────────────────────\nMUST be opioid-free before starting:\n├── 7-14 days from short-acting opioids\n├── 10-14 days from methadone/buprenorphine\n└── Naloxone challenge test can verify\n\nWHY THE WAIT:\nNaltrexone will precipitate withdrawal if ANY opioids\nare still on receptors. Unlike buprenorphine,\nnaltrexone has ZERO agonist activity to provide comfort.\n\nNOT APPROPRIATE FOR:\n├── Active opioid use (can't get opioid-free)\n├── Chronic pain requiring opioids\n├── Those not ready for abstinence-based approach\n├── Unreliable for daily oral (injection preferred)\n└── Liver disease (check LFTs)\n\nOVERDOSE RISK AFTER STOPPING:\nWhen naltrexone wears off, tolerance is GONE.\nUsing previous dose after stopping → overdose risk.\nCritical education point.\n```\n\n## Medications for Alcohol Use Disorder\n\n### Naltrexone (for Alcohol)\n\n```\nNALTREXONE FOR ALCOHOL\n──────────────────────\nSame medication, different mechanism for alcohol:\n├── Blocks endorphin release from drinking\n├── Drinking becomes less pleasurable\n├── Can continue drinking (Sinclair Method)\n├── Or use for abstinence support\n└── 50mg oral daily OR monthly Vivitrol\n\nSINCLAIR METHOD:\n├── Take naltrexone 1 hour before drinking\n├── Continue drinking as usual\n├── Brain learns drinking ≠ reward\n├── Gradual reduction over 6-12 months\n├── 78% success rate in Finnish studies\n└── NOT abstinence-based (controversial)\n```\n\n### Acamprosate (Campral)\n\n```\nACAMPROSATE\n───────────\nHOW IT WORKS:\n├── Restores glutamate/GABA balance\n├── Brain chemistry disrupted by chronic alcohol\n├── Reduces post-acute withdrawal symptoms\n└── Supports abstinence maintenance\n\nDOSING:\n├── 666mg three times daily (1998mg total)\n├── Start after alcohol withdrawal complete\n├── Takes 5-7 days to reach effectiveness\n└── Continue for 12 months typically\n\nBEST FOR:\n├── Maintaining abstinence (not reducing)\n├── Those who have detoxed\n├── Post-acute withdrawal symptoms\n├── Can combine with naltrexone\n└── Safe with liver disease\n```\n\n### Disulfiram (Antabuse)\n\n```\nDISULFIRAM\n──────────\nHOW IT WORKS:\n├── Blocks alcohol metabolism\n├── Acetaldehyde builds up → very sick\n├── Creates aversion to drinking\n└── Deterrent effect (fear of reaction)\n\nTHE REACTION (if you drink):\n├── Flushing, headache\n├── Nausea, vomiting\n├── Rapid heartbeat, low BP\n├── Difficulty breathing\n├── Can be severe/dangerous\n└── Starts within 10 min, lasts hours\n\nDOSING:\n├── 250-500mg daily\n├── Must wait 12 hours after last drink\n├── Effects last 1-2 weeks after stopping\n└── Cannot have ANY alcohol (cooking, mouthwash)\n\nBEST FOR:\n├── Highly motivated patients\n├── Those with external accountability\n├── Supervised administration works best\n├── NOT for impulsive drinkers\n└── Medical monitoring recommended\n```\n\n## Medication Comparison Table\n\n| Medication | Type | Frequency | Can Use While On It? | Overdose Risk | Best For |\n|------------|------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|----------|\n| Buprenorphine | Partial agonist | Daily/monthly | No (blocked) | Low | Opioid maintenance |\n| Methadone | Full agonist | Daily | No (tolerance) | Medium | High-tolerance opioid users |\n| Naltrexone | Antagonist | Daily/monthly | No (blocked) | None from med | Abstinence-motivated |\n| Acamprosate | Modulator | 3x daily | N/A (for alcohol) | None | Alcohol abstinence |\n| Disulfiram | Aversive | Daily | DANGEROUS | None from med | Alcohol deterrence |\n\n## Common Myths vs. Facts\n\n```\nMYTH: \"MAT is just substituting one drug for another\"\nFACT: MAT medications are evidence-based treatments that:\n      - Normalize brain function\n      - Don't produce euphoria at therapeutic doses\n      - Allow people to work, parent, live fully\n      - Reduce mortality by 50%+\n\nMYTH: \"You're not really sober on MAT\"\nFACT: Recovery is not defined by medication status.\n      Stability, quality of life, and function matter.\n      Would you say a diabetic isn't \"healthy\" on insulin?\n\nMYTH: \"You should get off MAT as quickly as possible\"\nFACT: Research shows longer MAT duration = better outcomes.\n      Tapering is a personal decision made with your doctor.\n      There's no rush. Stability first.\n\nMYTH: \"MAT is only for severe addiction\"\nFACT: MAT is appropriate across the severity spectrum.\n      Earlier intervention often means better outcomes.\n      Don't need to hit \"rock bottom.\"\n\nMYTH: \"I'll be on MAT forever\"\nFACT: Duration is individual. Some stay on long-term (fine!).\n      Others taper successfully after years of stability.\n      This is between you and your treatment team.\n```\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Provider\n\n1. Which MAT option is best for my situation?\n2. What are the side effects I should watch for?\n3. How long should I expect to be on this medication?\n4. What happens if I relapse while on MAT?\n5. Can I take this medication if I'm pregnant/planning pregnancy?\n6. Will this interfere with my other medications?\n7. What's the plan if the first medication doesn't work?\n8. How will we measure if this is working?\n\n---\n\n**Remember**: MAT is a tool, not a crutch. Combined with counseling and support, it saves lives. Talk to your medical team about what's right for you.\n"

(eat something nutritious)\n├── A - Angry? (process the emotion)\n├── L - Lonely? (reach out to someone)\n└── T - Tired? (rest if possible)\n\nThen STOP:\n├── S - Stop what you're doing\n├── T - Take a breath\n├── O - Observe what you're feeling\n└── P - Proceed mindfully\n```\n\n### Grounding Techniques (5-4-3-2-1)\n\n```\nFor anxiety, dissociation, or overwhelming cravings:\n\n5 things you can SEE\n├── Look around, name them out loud\n\n4 things you can TOUCH\n├── Feel textures, temperatures\n\n3 things you can HEAR\n├── Ambient sounds, near and far\n\n2 things you can SMELL\n├── Notice scents in your environment\n\n1 thing you can TASTE\n├── Focus on current taste in your mouth\n```\n\n### DBT Distress Tolerance (TIP Skills)\n\n```\nFor high-intensity emotional moments:\n\nT - Temperature\n├── Hold ice cubes, cold water on face\n├── Activates dive reflex, calms nervous system\n\nI - Intense Exercise\n├── Run in place, jumping jacks, stairs\n├── Burns off stress hormones\n\nP - Paced Breathing\n├── Breathe out longer than in (4-7-8 pattern)\n├── Activates parasympathetic system\n\nP - Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n├── Tense and release muscle groups\n├── Releases physical tension\n```\n\n### Urge Surfing\n\n```\nInstead of fighting the craving, ride it like a wave:\n\n1. Notice the urge (don't judge it)\n2. Rate its intensity (1-10)\n3. Observe where you feel it in your body\n4. Breathe into that area\n5. Watch the intensity rise...\n6. ...peak...\n7. ...and fall (cravings typically last 15-30 minutes)\n8. Rate the intensity again\n\nKey insight: Cravings are temporary. You don't have to act on them.\n```\n\n## Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)\n\n### Understanding Your MAT Options\n\n| Medication | Used For | How It Works | Key Considerations |\n|------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Suboxone** (buprenorphine/naloxone) | Opioid use | Partial agonist, blocks cravings | Must be in withdrawal to start |\n| **Sublocade** | Opioid use | Monthly injection of buprenorphine | Steady levels, no daily dosing |\n| **Methadone** | Opioid use | Full agonist, daily dosing | Clinic visits required |\n| **Vivitrol** | Opioid/alcohol | Blocks receptors, monthly injection | Must be opioid-free 7-14 days |\n| **Naltrexone** (oral) | Opioid/alcohol | Blocks receptors, daily pill | Reduces \"high\" from use |\n| **Antabuse** | Alcohol | Creates nausea if drinking | Deterrent effect |\n| **Campral** | Alcohol | Balances brain chemistry | Reduces cravings |\n\n### MAT Myths vs. Facts\n\n```\nMYTH: \"MAT is just trading one drug for another\"\nFACT: MAT is evidence-based medicine that normalizes brain function,\n      reduces cravings, and saves lives. It's no different than using\n      insulin for diabetes.\n\nMYTH: \"You're not really sober if you're on MAT\"\nFACT: Recovery is not defined by the absence of medication.\n      Stability, function, and quality of life are what matter.\n\nMYTH: \"You should get off MAT as soon as possible\"\nFACT: Research shows longer MAT duration = better outcomes.\n      The decision to taper should be made with your doctor when stable.\n```\n\n## Living Situation Considerations\n\n### Residential Treatment\n\n```\nMaking the Most of Residential:\n├── Engage fully in programming\n├── Build relationships with peers and staff\n├── Follow the structure (it's there for a reason)\n├── Be honest in groups and with your counselor\n├── Use free time productively\n├── Start planning for aftercare early\n└── Practice skills in a safe environment\n```\n\n### IOP/PHP (Outpatient - Living at Home)\n\n```\nCommuting to Treatment Challenges:\n├── Returning home to triggers daily\n├── Managing home responsibilities + treatment\n├── Partners/family who don't understand\n├── Work/childcare conflicts\n├── Isolation between sessions\n└── Access to substances\n\nStrategies:\n├── Secure your home environment (remove substances)\n├── Communicate with family about boundaries\n├── Build structure into non-treatment hours\n├── Attend extra meetings on non-treatment days\n├── Keep your counselor informed of home challenges\n├── Have phone numbers ready for crisis moments\n└── Consider sober living if home isn't safe\n```\n\n## Family & Relationship Dynamics\n\n### Communicating with Partners/Family\n\n```\nWhat families need to understand:\n├── Addiction is a brain disease, not a moral failing\n├── Recovery is a process, not an event\n├── Their role: support, not control\n├── Boundaries are healthy for everyone\n├── Al-Anon/Nar-Anon exists for them too\n\nWhat you can communicate:\n├── \"I'm in treatment and taking this seriously\"\n├── \"This is what I need from you right now: [specific request]\"\n├── \"I understand I've hurt you. I'm working on making amends\"\n├── \"Recovery is my responsibility. I need your support, not your management\"\n├── \"Let's work on this together with a family counselor\"\n```\n\n### Couples Therapy in Recovery\n\n```\nWhy couples therapy matters:\n├── Addiction affects the whole relationship\n├── Communication patterns need rebuilding\n├── Trust takes time and structured work\n├── Both partners have healing to do\n├── Codependency patterns need addressing\n\nWhen to start:\n├── Usually after initial stabilization (30-90 days)\n├── When both partners are willing\n├── With a therapist who understands addiction\n├── As complement to individual work, not replacement\n```\n\n## Holistic Wellness\n\n### Daily Recovery Structure\n\n```\nMorning Routine:\n├── Gratitude list (3 things)\n├── Meditation/prayer (5-15 min)\n├── Healthy breakfast\n├── Review daily intentions\n└── Morning meeting (if helpful)\n\nThroughout Day:\n├── Regular check-ins with self\n├── Meals at consistent times\n├── Movement/exercise\n├── Connection with recovery support\n└── Practice skills from treatment\n\nEvening Routine:\n├── Review the day (what went well?)\n├── 10th step inventory (if in 12-step)\n├── Prepare for tomorrow\n├── Wind-down activities (no screens)\n└── Consistent bedtime\n```\n\n### Nutrition & Sleep\n\n```\nNutrition in Recovery:\n├── Regular meals stabilize blood sugar and mood\n├── Protein helps rebuild neurotransmitters\n├── Reduce sugar/caffeine (can trigger cravings)\n├── Stay hydrated\n└── Consider consulting nutritionist\n\nSleep Hygiene:\n├── Consistent sleep/wake times\n├── No screens 1 hour before bed\n├── Cool, dark room\n├── Limit caffeine after noon\n├── Address sleep issues with your doctor\n└── Many in recovery have disrupted sleep initially - it improves\n```\n\n## Common Challenges & Solutions\n\n### \"I feel like I don't fit in at meetings\"\n\n```\nOptions:\n├── Try different meetings (they vary widely)\n├── Try different programs (SMART, Refuge, LifeRing)\n├── Look for specialized meetings (LGBTQ+, young people, professionals)\n├── Online meetings offer more variety\n├── Focus on similarities, not differences\n└── Give it time - connection builds gradually\n```\n\n### \"My family doesn't trust me\"\n\n```\nUnderstanding:\n├── Trust is rebuilt through consistent action over time\n├── It's not about proving yourself - it's about being yourself\n├── Their caution is protective, not punishing\n├── Focus on what you CAN control (your behavior)\n\nActions:\n├── Be where you say you'll be\n├── Follow through on commitments\n├── Accept accountability without defensiveness\n├── Let time and consistency work\n└── Consider family therapy when appropriate\n```\n\n### \"I'm bored without substances\"\n\n```\nThe Science:\n├── Dopamine system is recalibrating\n├── Things will feel less pleasurable for a while\n├── This is temporary (neuroplasticity!)\n\nSolutions:\n├── Exercise (natural dopamine boost)\n├── New hobbies (guitar, art, gaming, sports)\n├── Service work (helping others)\n├── Social connection (even when you don't feel like it)\n├── Accept boredom as part of healing\n└── Structure your time intentionally\n```\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- **sober-addict-protector**: Daily protection strategies\n- **partner-text-coach**: Communication with partners/family\n- **jungian-psychologist**: Shadow work and deeper psychological exploration\n- **hrv-alexithymia-expert**: Emotional awareness and regulation\n\n---\n\n**Core Philosophy**: Recovery is possible. You are more than your addiction. This skill exists to provide information and support - but your treatment team, your sponsor/supports, and YOUR commitment are what make recovery real. Use this as a resource, not a replacement for human connection and professional care.\n"
