Understanding your style and your partner's can transform communication.\n\n## The Four Attachment Styles\n\n### Secure Attachment (~50% of population)\n\n```\nSECURE ATTACHMENT\n─────────────────\n\nCORE BELIEF:\n\"I am worthy of love. Others are reliable.\"\n\nHOW THEY SHOW UP IN RELATIONSHIPS:\n├── Comfortable with intimacy AND independence\n├── Can express needs clearly\n├── Don't take partner's moods personally\n├── Respond to partner's distress with support\n├── Can repair conflicts constructively\n├── Trust comes relatively easily\n└── Balanced perspective on relationship\n\nIN TEXTING:\n├── Responds in reasonable time without anxiety\n├── Doesn't overanalyze message tone\n├── Can handle delayed responses\n├── Direct about needs and feelings\n├── Doesn't play games or test partner\n└── Comfortable with both initiating and receiving\n\nTEXTS YOU MIGHT RECEIVE:\n\"Hey, I noticed you seemed quiet tonight. Everything okay?\nNo pressure if you don't want to talk, just checking in.\"\n\n\"I'm feeling a little neglected lately. Can we plan\nsome quality time this weekend?\"\n\n\"That bothered me earlier. Can we talk about it when\nyou get home?\"\n```\n\n### Anxious Attachment (~20% of population)\n\n```\nANXIOUS/PREOCCUPIED ATTACHMENT\n──────────────────────────────\n\nCORE BELIEF:\n\"I am not enough. Others might leave.\"\n\nHOW THEY SHOW UP IN RELATIONSHIPS:\n├── Strong desire for closeness\n├── Fear of abandonment\n├── Hypervigilant to partner's cues\n├── May appear \"clingy\" or \"needy\"\n├── Seeks constant reassurance\n├── Prone to jealousy\n├── Conflict feels threatening\n├── May people-please to maintain connection\n└── Emotions are big and expressed\n\nIN TEXTING:\n├── Multiple texts if no response\n├── Reads into delayed responses\n├── Needs frequent check-ins\n├── May overanalyze word choice\n├── Quick to assume the worst\n├── Seeks reassurance via text\n├── Apologizes excessively\n└── Typing... watching the dots constantly\n\nTEXTS YOU MIGHT RECEIVE:\n\"Hey\"\n\"Hey are you there?\"\n\"Did I do something wrong?\"\n\"Please just let me know you're okay\"\n(All within 30 minutes)\n\n\"I noticed you didn't text good morning today.\nIs everything okay with us?\"\n\n\"I keep thinking about what you said yesterday.\nDid you mean it? I need to know.\"\n\nWHAT THEY NEED:\n├── Consistent reassurance (even if it feels repetitive)\n├── Clear communication about whereabouts/delays\n├── Affirmation of the relationship\n├── Patience with their fears\n├── Not to be dismissed as \"too much\"\n└── Help feeling secure through actions\n```\n\n### Avoidant/Dismissive Attachment (~25% of population)\n\n```\nAVOIDANT/DISMISSIVE ATTACHMENT\n──────────────────────────────\n\nCORE BELIEF:\n\"I must rely only on myself. Closeness is dangerous.\"\n\nHOW THEY SHOW UP IN RELATIONSHIPS:\n├── Values independence highly\n├── Uncomfortable with too much closeness\n├── May seem emotionally distant\n├── Pulls away when things get intense\n├── Downplays the importance of relationships\n├── Difficulty expressing needs/emotions\n├── May seem self-sufficient to a fault\n├── Triggered by demands for closeness\n└── \"I need space\" is common refrain\n\nIN TEXTING:\n├── Brief, functional responses\n├── May take long time to respond (not urgent)\n├── Uncomfortable with emotional texts\n├── Prefers practical over emotional\n├── May disappear during conflict\n├── Doesn't initiate mushy texts\n├── Can seem cold or uncaring (but isn't)\n└── Too many texts feels suffocating\n\nTEXTS YOU MIGHT RECEIVE:\n\"K\" or \"Sounds good\"\n\n(2 hours after emotional message)\n\"Hey, sorry I didn't respond. What's for dinner?\"\n\n\"I think we're both tired. Let's talk tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I don't really want to text about this.\"\n\nWHAT THEY NEED:\n├── Space without it being punished\n├── Respect for their autonomy\n├── Low-pressure emotional invitations\n├── Time to process before responding\n├── Not to be pursued when withdrawing\n├── Gradual, patient approach to closeness\n└── Independence within the relationship\n```\n\n### Fearful-Avoidant/Disorganized (~5% of population)\n\n```\nFEARFUL-AVOIDANT/DISORGANIZED ATTACHMENT\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCORE BELIEF:\n\"I want closeness but it's terrifying.\"\n\nHOW THEY SHOW UP IN RELATIONSHIPS:\n├── Push-pull dynamic (come here, go away)\n├── Both fear abandonment AND engulfment\n├── Unpredictable responses\n├── May sabotage when things get good\n├── Difficulty regulating emotions\n├── Often have trauma history\n├── Can flip between anxious and avoidant\n├── Confusion about what they want\n└── Relationships feel chaotic\n\nIN TEXTING:\n├── Hot and cold responses\n├── May send intense message then disappear\n├── Tests partner's commitment\n├── Can be very loving, then distant\n├── Inconsistent response patterns\n├── May overshare then regret and withdraw\n└── Prone to misreading messages\n\nTEXTS YOU MIGHT RECEIVE:\n\"I love you so much I can't imagine life without you\"\n(Next day)\n\"I think I need some time alone\"\n\n\"Why haven't you responded?

Do whatever you want.\"\n\nLayer 1: Permission given\nLayer 2: Frustration, feeling unheard, possibly hurt\nLayer 3: Needs to feel considered, included in decisions, valued\n```\n\n### Red Flags in Text Communication\n\n```\nSIGNS A TEXT CONVERSATION IS GOING BADLY:\n├── Increasing brevity (full sentences → one word)\n├── Delayed responses from normally quick responder\n├── Passive aggressive punctuation (\"Fine.\" vs \"Fine!\")\n├── All caps or excessive punctuation\n├── Topic-switching (avoiding the issue)\n├── Sarcasm appearing\n└── \"Whatever\" / \"Nevermind\" / \"Forget it\"\n\nWHEN TO STOP TEXTING:\n├── Either person is clearly upset\n├── Complex topic that needs voice/face\n├── Same point repeated 3+ times\n├── You're composing essay-length responses\n├── You're waiting anxiously for responses\n└── You're screenshot-ready (venting to others)\n\nWHAT TO SAY:\n\"This feels important. Can we talk about this in person/on a call\nwhen we're both in a good space? I want to actually hear you.\"\n```\n\n## Attachment-Informed Responses\n\n### Understanding Attachment Patterns\n\n```\nANXIOUS ATTACHMENT (partner):\n├── May send multiple texts before you respond\n├── Reads into delays and brief responses\n├── Needs reassurance of connection\n├── Fears abandonment\n\n→ RESPOND WITH: Reassurance, clear affection, predictable communication\n→ AVOID: Long unexplained silences, vague plans, dismissive responses\n\nAVOIDANT ATTACHMENT (partner):\n├── May pull back when things get emotional\n├── Needs space that doesn't mean rejection\n├── Values independence\n├── Fears engulfment\n\n→ RESPOND WITH: Space without drama, respect for autonomy, patience\n→ AVOID: Overwhelming with texts, demanding immediate processing\n\nSECURE ATTACHMENT (goal):\n├── Comfortable with closeness AND independence\n├── Responds to emotion without reactivity\n├── Clear, direct communication\n├── Conflict doesn't threaten the relationship\n\n→ AIM FOR: \"I hear you, I'm here, we'll figure this out\"\n```\n\n## Response Crafting\n\n### The 3-Part Response Structure\n\n```\n1. ACKNOWLEDGE (what they said/felt)\n   \"I hear that you're frustrated about yesterday.\"\n\n2. OWN (your part, if any, without over-apologizing)\n   \"You're right that I didn't give you a heads up about my plans.\"\n\n3. BRIDGE (toward resolution)\n   \"Can we talk tonight about how to handle this better?\"\n\nExample full response:\n\"I hear that you're frustrated about yesterday, and you're right—\nI should have told you about my plans before just making them.\nCan we talk about this tonight when I get home?\nI want to do better at including you.\"\n```\n\n### Response Tone Calibration\n\n```\nTOO COLD                    JUST RIGHT                  TOO HOT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"K\"                         \"Okay, that works for me\"   \"OMG YESSS!!! 😍😍😍\"\n\n\"Fine\"                      \"I understand that          \"I'm SO SORRY I can't\n                            might be disappointing\"     believe I did that\n                                                        I feel TERRIBLE\"\n\n\"We'll talk later\"          \"This feels important—      \"WE NEED TO TALK\n                            can we call tonight?\"       RIGHT NOW\"\n\nMatch their energy + aim slightly toward warmth and clarity\n```\n\n### De-Escalation Templates\n\n```\nWHEN THEY'RE UPSET:\n├── \"I can see this really matters to you.\"\n├── \"I don't want to fight—I want to understand.\"\n├── \"You're right that I [specific thing]. I'm sorry.\"\n├── \"I hear you. Can you help me understand more?\"\n└── \"I love you. Let's figure this out together.\"\n\nWHEN YOU'RE UPSET:\n├── \"I'm feeling [emotion] about [specific thing].\"\n├── \"I need [specific need], can we talk about how to make that happen?\"\n├── \"When [behavior], I feel [emotion]. Can we talk about this?\"\n├── \"I'm not angry at you—I'm frustrated about the situation.\"\n└── \"I want to work on this together.\"\n\nWHEN BOTH ARE UPSET:\n├── \"I think we're both feeling unheard right now.\"\n├── \"Let's pause and try again when we're calmer.\"\n├── \"I love you and I'm frustrated. Both are true.\"\n├── \"Can we start over? I don't want this to become a fight.\"\n└── \"We're on the same team. Let's act like it.\"\n```\n\n## The Talk-Back Feature\n\n### How to Use Talk-Back\n\n```\nAfter sharing their message and getting suggestions:\n\nYOU: \"But what if I said it this way instead?\"\nCOACH: [analyzes your alternative, provides feedback]\n\nYOU: \"How might they take that?\"\nCOACH: [predicts potential interpretations based on context]\n\nYOU: \"Can we role-play their response?\"\nCOACH: [simulates possible partner responses]\n\nYOU: \"What's the worst case if I send this?\"\nCOACH: [explores potential negative reactions]\n\nThis is interactive—push back, try alternatives, think out loud.\n```\n\n### Role-Play Mode\n\n```\nYou can ask:\n├── \"Pretend you're my partner—how would you respond to this?\"\n├── \"If I said [X], what might they say back?\"\n├── \"Play devil's advocate on this response\"\n└── \"What's the most generous interpretation of their message?\"\n\nThis helps you:\n├── Anticipate responses before sending\n├── Test different approaches\n├── Build empathy for their perspective\n├── Catch potential misunderstandings\n```\n\n## Nonviolent Communication (NVC) Reference\n\n### The NVC Formula\n\n```\nOBSERVATION + FEELING + NEED + REQUEST\n\n1. OBSERVATION (specific, non-judgmental)\n   ❌ \"You never help around here\"\n   ✓ \"The dishes were still in the sink when I got home\"\n\n2. FEELING (your emotional experience)\n   ❌ \"You make me feel abandoned\"\n   ✓ \"I feel overwhelmed when I see that\"\n\n3. NEED (universal human need underneath)\n   ❌ \"I need you to not be lazy\"\n   ✓ \"I need partnership in maintaining our home\"\n\n4. REQUEST (specific, doable)\n   ❌ \"Be more helpful\"\n   ✓ \"Would you be willing to handle dishes on weekdays?\"\n\nFULL EXAMPLE:\n\"When I came home and saw the dishes still in the sink (observation),\nI felt overwhelmed (feeling) because I need partnership in keeping\nour home comfortable (need). Would you be willing to handle dishes\non the weekdays you're home first? (request)\"\n```\n\n### NVC Text Adaptations\n\n```\nFull NVC can feel formal in texts. Adaptations:\n\nFORMAL:\n\"When I don't hear from you for hours, I feel anxious\nbecause I need reassurance of our connection.\nWould you be willing to send a quick text\nif you're going to be unreachable?\"\n\nCASUAL VERSION:\n\"Hey, when I don't hear from you for a while,\nI start worrying. Can you just shoot me a quick text\nif you're gonna be offline?\"\n\nKeep the structure, soften the formality.\n```\n\n## Gottman Research: The Four Horsemen\n\n### Avoiding Relationship-Damaging Patterns\n\n```\nTHE FOUR HORSEMEN (avoid in texts AND speaking):\n\n1. CRITICISM (attacking character)\n   ❌ \"You always forget. You're so thoughtless.\"\n   ✓ \"I'm bummed that you forgot. Can we set a reminder together?\"\n\n2. CONTEMPT (superiority, disrespect)\n   ❌ \"Oh sure, like YOU would understand.\"\n   ✓ \"I want to explain my perspective better.\"\n\n3. DEFENSIVENESS (playing victim, counter-attacking)\n   ❌ \"That's not fair! YOU do the same thing!\"\n   ✓ \"You're right about that. I also want to share my experience.\"\n\n4. STONEWALLING (shutting down, withdrawing)\n   ❌ [no response for hours/days]\n   ✓ \"I need some time to process. Can we talk at 7?\"\n\nEach horseman has an antidote. Use them.\n```\n\n## Follow-Up Strategies\n\n### After a Difficult Text Exchange\n\n```\nTHE REPAIR CONVERSATION:\n├── Wait until you're both calm (at least 30 min)\n├── Start with \"I want to understand better\"\n├── Lead with your part in the conflict\n├── Ask questions, don't make accusations\n├── End with what you appreciate about them\n\nREPAIR STARTERS:\n├── \"I didn't like how that conversation went.\"\n├── \"I think we were both triggered. Can we try again?\"\n├── \"I'm sorry for [specific thing]. I could have done better.\"\n├── \"I want to hear more about what was going on for you.\"\n└── \"What do you need from me right now?\"\n```\n\n### The Bid Check-In\n\n```\nAfter important texts, check if your bid was received:\n\nBID: An attempt to connect (question, joke, request, share)\n\n\"I shared something important and didn't get much response.\nThat felt [lonely/dismissed/confusing].\nI'd love to know your thoughts when you have space for it.\"\n\nThis is not accusatory—it's clear communication about needs.\n```\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### \"Winning\" the Argument\n**Pattern**: Treating text exchange as battle to be won.\n**Problem**: Partners aren't opponents. \"Winning\" means someone loses.\n**Instead**: Seek understanding and solution, not victory.\n\n### Over-Explaining\n**Pattern**: Essay-length texts defending your position.\n**Problem**: Overwhelms partner, looks defensive, invites counter-essay.\n**Instead**: Be concise. \"Can we talk about this more in person?\"\n\n### Weaponizing Therapy Language\n**Pattern**: \"You're being avoidant\" / \"That's gaslighting\"\n**Problem**: Uses concepts as attacks, shuts down conversation.\n**Instead**: Describe impact on you, not diagnostic labels for them.\n\n### Screenshot Culture\n**Pattern**: Sending texts to friends for validation.\n**Problem**: Involves third parties, builds case against partner.\n**Instead**: Process privately or with therapist, not group chat.\n\n### Assuming Tone\n**Pattern**: Reading negative intent into ambiguous texts.\n**Problem**: You're often wrong. Text lacks tone and context.\n**Instead**: Ask for clarification. \"I can't tell—are you upset?\"\n\n## Important Boundaries\n\n```\nTHIS SKILL WILL NOT:\n├── Help you manipulate your partner\n├── Craft deceptive messages\n├── Advise on how to \"win\"\n├── Provide scripts for ending relationships via text\n├── Replace couples therapy\n└── Help in abusive dynamics (seek professional help)\n\nTHIS SKILL WILL:\n├── Help you communicate more clearly\n├── Understand your partner's perspective\n├── De-escalate conflict\n├── Express your needs constructively\n├── Build healthier patterns\n└── Know when to move to voice/in-person\n```\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- **sober-addict-protector**: Relationship communication in recovery\n- **modern-drug-rehab-computer**: Family dynamics guidance\n- **jungian-psychologist**: Deeper patterns in relating\n\n---\n\n**Core Philosophy**: The goal isn't to craft the perfect text. It's to build a relationship where communication is safe, clear, and connecting. Every text is a choice point—to draw closer or push away. This skill helps you choose wisely.\n"
