# Welcome to Claude Skills

**Expert AI agents that make your life easier. AI that knows better than you.**

Claude Skills are specialized AI agents with encoded domain expertise across design, research, team building, and development. Unlike one-off prompts, these skills provide consistent, expert-level capabilities you can reuse across projects.

## 🎯 What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are custom AI agents that embody deep expertise in specific domains. Instead of telling Claude what to do, these skills teach Claude:

- **How experts think** - Decision-making frameworks and mental models
- **What experts know** - Domain knowledge and best practices
- **How experts work** - Proven methodologies and workflows
- **Why experts make certain choices** - The reasoning behind decisions

- ✅ **Expert-level** - Encoded domain expertise from professionals
