# The Council Archives

## Reading the Archives

The archives serve multiple purposes:

1. **Historical Record** — Understanding how the ecosystem evolved
2. **Decision Context** — Why certain choices were made
3. **Learning Resource** — Patterns that worked (and didn't)
4. **Onboarding** — New contributors can understand the journey

## Contributing

The archives grow automatically through:
- Liaison reports after significant sessions
- Archivist snapshots at key milestones
- Council briefings before major decisions
