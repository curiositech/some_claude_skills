# Liaison Reports

> *"I am your window into the ecosystem. When agents build, I tell you. When opportunities arise, I show you. When decisions need you, I bring them clearly."*
> — The Liaison

The Liaison serves as the bridge between complex agent activity and human understanding. These are the official communications to the Human Steward.

## 2025-12-06: The Forge Recommendation

**Type:** Decision Request
**Priority:** High
**From:** The Liaison
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

### The Situation

During ecosystem analysis, an infrastructure gap was identified. While we have 52 skills and 9 agents, we lack dedicated tooling for:

1. Automated skill validation
2. Cross-skill dependency management
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Integration testing

### The Recommendation

Create "The Forge" — a dedicated infrastructure project for building, testing, and validating skills at scale.

### Proposed Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Skill Validator | Automated SKILL.md compliance checking |
| Dependency Analyzer | Cross-reference detection |
| Benchmark Suite | Performance measurement |
| Integration Harness | Multi-skill testing |

### Expected Outcomes

- Faster skill iteration cycles
- Fewer integration issues
- Measurable quality metrics
- Scalable testing infrastructure

### Decision Required

Approve The Forge as the next major infrastructure initiative.

### Resolution

**APPROVED** by Human Steward on 2025-12-06.

The Forge will be prioritized in the next development epoch.
