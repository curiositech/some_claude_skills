# Growth & Sustainability

## Phase 4: $1K → $5K MRR

### System-Based Growth

**Daily Non-Negotiables (30 min max)**

Pick ONE channel, execute DAILY:

**Option A: Content Marketing (Twitter)**
```
- Morning: 1 tweet about what you're building
- Afternoon: Reply to 5 relevant tweets
- Evening: 1 tip/insight from your domain
```

**Option B: Community Presence (Reddit/Discord)**
```
- Help 3 people with genuine advice
- Share your progress once
- Collect feedback on your product
```

**Option C: Direct Outreach**
```
- Find 5 potential customers (Twitter, Reddit)
- Send personalized message (not sales-y)
- Offer free trial or consultation
```

### Track Your Progress
```
┌──────┬────────┬──────────┬─────────┐
│ Date │ Action │ Response │ Results │
├──────┼────────┼──────────┼─────────┤
│ 1/15 │ 3 DMs  │ 1 reply  │ 1 trial │
│ 1/16 │ 2 tweets│ 5 likes │ -       │
└──────┴────────┴──────────┴─────────┘

Skip a day? Fine. Don't abandon the system.
```

### Pricing Strategy (ADHD-Friendly)

**Start with:**
- B2C: $29/month or $199/year
- B2B: $99/month or $999/year

**Why these numbers:**
- High enough to be sustainable
- Low enough to charge without sales call
- Annual = cash flow + retention
- Higher than you think (ex-FAANG trap: pricing too low)

**Common mistake:**
```
❌ $9/month (need 556 users for $5K MRR)
✅ $49/month (need 102 users for $5K MRR)
```

### Retention > Acquisition

**ADHD-Friendly Retention System**

Weekly (Automated):
- Email: Tips on using your product
- In-app: Progress/stats reminder
- Check: Any users not active? Email them.

Monthly (Manual - 1 hour):
- Email top 10 users: "What would make this 10x better?"
- Review churn: Why did people cancel?
- One feature improvement based on feedback

**Goal: 90%+ monthly retention**
You can't out-market churn with ADHD brain.

## Phase 5: Sustainability ($5K-$10K MRR)

### The Sustainable Indie Hacker Playbook

**Primary App (80% revenue):**
- 4 hours/week: Critical bugs + feature requests
- Automated: Payments, emails, onboarding
- Hired: Customer support (VA, $500/month)
- Status: "Maintenance mode" = stable income

**New Project (20% exploration):**
- Validate idea in 1 week
- MVP in 2 weeks
- Launch in week 3-4
- If works: Scale
- If doesn't: Shut down, move on

**Why this works for ADHD:**
- ✅ Dopamine from new projects
- ✅ Safety of stable income
- ✅ Permission to experiment
- ✅ Not abandoning what works

### The Anti-Burnout System

**Boundaries (Sacred):**
```
Work hours: 10am - 4pm (max 6 hours deep work)
No work: Evenings, weekends (seriously)
Exercise: Daily (non-negotiable, ADHD regulation)
Sleep: 7-8 hours (your brain needs it)
```

**Revenue goals:**
```
- $5K/month = sustainable
- $10K/month = comfortable
- $20K/month = thriving
```

Don't optimize beyond $20K MRR unless you WANT to scale.
More money ≠ more happiness with ADHD.

If business is up but ADHD health is down:
→ Unsustainable. Adjust immediately.

If both are down:
→ Take a break. Go outside. Reset.

If both are up:
→ You've found the sweet spot. Maintain.
