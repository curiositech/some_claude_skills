# Junkie Buds 4 Life Community Standards

> "We meet people where they are, not where we think they should be."

## Welcome

This is a place for people in recovery — whatever that looks like for you.

### We Believe

- You are the expert on your own recovery
- All pathways have value (AA, NA, SMART, MAT, harm reduction, abstinence, faith-based, secular)
- Struggling doesn't mean failing
- You belong here

## How We Roll

### Share Your Experience

Say "This is what worked for me" instead of "You should do this."

Recovery is personal. What saved your life might not work for someone else, and that's okay.

### Respect Post Modes

Authors can choose how they want to engage:

| Mode | What It Means | What's Allowed |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| 🔇 **No Crosstalk** | "I just need to say this" | Emoji reactions only |
| 👂 **Just Listening** | Seeking witness, not solutions | Gentle affirmations |
| 💬 **Open Discussion** | Ready for conversation | Full comments |
| 🆘 **Seeking Support** | "Please help me think through this" | Advice welcome |

### Disagree with Dignity

You can challenge ideas without attacking people.

✅ "I've had a different experience with AA..."
❌ "You're an idiot for thinking AA works"

### No Sourcing

We're here for recovery, not procurement. Don't ask where to get substances.

### Keep It Here

What's shared in the community stays in the community. Don't reveal who attends meetings or share identifying information about other members.

## What Gets You Warned

These behaviors will result in a warning:

- Giving unsolicited advice after someone asks you to stop
- Gatekeeping recovery ("That's not REAL recovery")
- Dismissing other recovery pathways
- Heated language that could be misread as an attack

Three warnings = temporary restriction from posting.

## What Gets You Removed

These will result in immediate content removal and possible suspension:

- **Personal attacks** - Attacking someone, not their ideas
- **Shaming** - "You relapsed because you're weak"
- **Coercion** - "You MUST do AA or you'll die"
- **Breaking anonymity** - Revealing others' meeting attendance
- **Spam** - Promoting products or services

## What Gets You Banned

- **Sourcing** - Asking where to obtain substances
- **Doxxing** - Sharing private information
- **Explicit self-harm content** - Detailed methods or instructions
- **Threats** - Violence toward yourself or others
- **Repeated violations** - After warnings and suspensions

## Crisis Support

If you're struggling right now, you're not alone.

- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** - Call or text 988
- **SAMHSA National Helpline** - 1-800-662-4357
- **Crisis Text Line** - Text HOME to 741741

**Important:** Posts expressing "I want to use" or "I can't do this anymore" are **not violations**. They're cries for support. The community will rally to help.

## Appeals

If you believe a moderation decision was wrong:

1. You'll receive a message explaining the action
2. Reply to that message with your appeal
3. A human moderator will review within 48 hours

We make mistakes. We want to hear from you.

## Our Commitment to You

We will:
- Be transparent about why content was removed
- Never ban without explanation
- Prioritize safety without being heavy-handed
- Listen to community feedback
- Update these standards as we learn
