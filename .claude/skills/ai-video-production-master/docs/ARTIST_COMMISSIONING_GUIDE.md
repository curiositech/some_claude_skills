# Artist Commissioning Guide for AI Training Datasets

## Why Commission Original Art?

### Legal Clarity
The U.S. Copyright Office's May 2025 report confirmed that using copyrighted works for AI training "clearly implicates the right of reproduction." While some uses qualify as fair use, commissioning original work eliminates ambiguity entirely.

### Strategic Advantages
1. **Unique Style** - No one else has your exact LoRA
2. **Legal Shield** - Clear ownership chain
3. **Quality Control** - Curated dataset = better results
4. **Ethical Foundation** - Artists compensated fairly
5. **Commercial Use** - No restrictions on derivative works

- Consider the long-term value you're receiving

### Credit
- Offer portfolio credit if artist wants it
- Don't claim the style as your original creation
- Acknowledge artistic origin in appropriate contexts

### Data Handling
